- Sunset Chase: Roof of Brabant – Clear Skies OnlySunsets are unpredictable – that's what makes this one special.
We only launch on Fridays, and only when the forecast promises truly open, clear skies for maximum drama. Decision always last-minute: we monitor the weather and confirm just days (or even hours) ahead. Thick clouds or rain? We cancel – no compromised views here. When the stars (and skies) align, meet right at the door of the historic Augustijnenkerk (Paterskerk) in central Eindhoven. From there, your expert local guide leads a scenic ride out to the Dak van Brabant – the "Roof of Brabant," an artificial hill topping out at 60 meters above sea level, the highest point in the entire province. Climb to the summit for sweeping 360° panoramas: forests, heathlands, distant city lights, and that epic, fiery Brabant sunset stretching across the horizon. Your guide shares the quirky backstory (old landfill turned viewpoint), landscape insights, and golden-hour tips. On the way back, a short, magical stop at the world-famous Daan Roosegaarde Van Gogh Bicycle Path – the glowing, twinkling trail inspired by Starry Night, lighting up as dusk settles for a surreal, artistic glow-up before the final roll home. Weather-dependent thrill: clear skies = unbeatable sunset from 60m up + glowing art path magic.
Fridays only | ~2.5–3 hours | under 30 km round trip | easy to moderate pace | city/hybrid bike perfect for the mix of roads and paths. Chase the perfect sky – we'll call it when it's on!

The full loop takes a solid 4 hours of relaxed yet immersive riding (with time to soak it all in).

## why go cycling?

Go cycling. Right now. Harder than yesterday.Because science doesn’t negotiate.

-   Cycling slashes all-cause mortality risk — people who ride regularly live measurably longer (up to 10–41% lower death risk in large reviews).
-   It carves 24% off your cardiovascular death risk and 16% off cancer compared to sitting in a car.
-   Heart attack, stroke, type 2 diabetes? Incidence drops hard when you pedal consistently.
-   Knees actually thank you: lifelong cyclists show healthier cartilage, less arthritis pain, lower osteoarthritis odds than non-riders.
-   Back & neck pain? Low-impact, upright posture on the bike strengthens core stabilizers, improves spinal alignment, reduces chronic load compared to sitting or bad walking form — many with persistent back/hip issues report real relief from regular riding.
-   Mental health frontline: regular cycling measurably cuts anxiety, depression symptoms, and perceived stress (studies show commuters who bike 4+ days/week have significantly lower stress odds). Endorphins flood, serotonin rises, cortisol falls. The mind quiets when the legs spin.
-   Bonus: better coordination, balance, lung capacity, insulin sensitivity, body composition, sleep quality — almost every system gets a systemic upgrade.

Every other “fix” has failed him at least once:
the magic pill that stopped working,
the guru stretch routine that flared everything worse,
the “just relax” advice that made guilt explode,
the fancy ergonomic chair that cost more than his bike.Only the bicycle has never lied.It doesn’t promise instant healing.
It promises movement against entropy — the single most powerful, cheapest, most accessible dose of medicine humanity has ever discovered.So when the mirror shows a man who feels like he’s quietly disintegrating,
when the inbox is screaming and the body is bargaining,
when the voice inside whispers “you’re falling apart” —he doesn’t scroll for another symptom checker.
He doesn’t book another specialist who’ll say “six more weeks.” He clips in.Rain? Pedal harder.
Headwind? Earn it.
Everything hurts? Especially then — because motion is the antidote to stagnation, and stagnation is death by boredom.Fifteen thousand kilometres later he’s still not “cured.”
But he’s stronger than the problems.
His heart is bigger, his arteries cleaner, his mind less haunted, his lifespan statistically longer.And when anyone asks — desperate, aching, at the end of their rope —“What the hell do I do when my whole body and brain are screaming?”He looks them dead in the eye and delivers the only answer that’s ever held true:Get on the bike. Ride like your life depends on it — because science says it does.Go cycling.
Now.
Harder.
Forever

## Help the Care System... Stay Away – Just Go Cycling!

The Netherlands has one of the best healthcare systems in the world – but it's under severe strain. Too few staff, endless waiting lists for specialists, GPs overwhelmed, and rising costs. Everyone feels it: patients wait longer, caregivers burn out, and simple health issues pile up pressure on an already stretched system.What if we could ease that burden ourselves – not by demanding more from the system, but by preventing many problems before they start? The answer is surprisingly simple and enjoyable: get on your bike, and do it together.Regular cycling is one of the most powerful forms of prevention available. Physically, it strengthens your heart and lungs, builds muscle, improves balance, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Studies show that cycling significantly reduces the risk of serious conditions like heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, and even early death. In the Netherlands alone, widespread cycling already prevents thousands of premature deaths each year and adds months – or more – to average life expectancy.But the benefits go far beyond the body. Mentally, cycling is a game-changer. Fresh air, movement, and the rhythm of pedaling reduce stress, lift your mood through endorphins, and combat feelings of anxiety or low energy. Many people feel noticeably happier and more resilient after a ride.And when you cycle in a group, the advantages multiply. You meet new people, build social connections, share laughs, and motivate each other. Group rides turn exercise into a fun, social event – far more sustainable than solitary gym sessions. Heading out of the city into nature, along quiet paths, dikes, or forests, gives a real mental reset that pure indoor activity rarely matches.The logic is clear: more regular cycling means fewer minor (and some major) physical complaints. Fewer aches, better fitness, stronger immunity – which translates directly to fewer visits to the already overloaded GP, fewer referrals, and less strain on waiting lists. Too much work and too little relaxation often leads to medical issues; a regular bike ride is one of the easiest, cheapest ways to restore balance.You don't need to be an athlete. Start easy: a weekly group ride of 20–40 km, a casual e-bike tour, or even shorter local loops with friends or a local cycling club. Many communities already have beginner-friendly groups – join one, or start your own.By choosing the bike more often – especially together – we invest in our own health and, at the same time, give the care system some much-needed breathing room. It's a win for everyone: healthier people, happier lives, and a less pressured healthcare future.So, this weekend: skip the excuses, grab your bike, call a friend or two, and head out. Help the care system… by staying away from it. Just go cycling!(Word count: ~480 – prints nicely on one A4 page with normal margins and font size 11–12.)
